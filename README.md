# 2000kcal Project

# PROBLEM

For most people who want to lose weight you are supposed to do only one thing: Consume less calories than you need. This often means:

1. Eat less than 2000 ckal
2. Still eat the right nutritional values. 

Trying to figure those two things out is very time consuming, you will have to track every food you eat with tools like http://myfitnesspal.com. These tools will tell you how much calories a certain food has and how much nutritional value it has. But:

1. Its hard to guess how much you actually ate of it. Unless it was the whole can. 
2. Those tools won't tell you WHAT to eat. 

So you are on your own, you have to create your own diet plans and try to tediously to stick to them. 

# IDEA

So what if people sat together and build daily 2000 kcal Packs that are build out of the existing products available in common super markets. These Packs can be either be:

1. Delivered to your door or 
2. Picked up bundled in your supermarket
3. With the use of an app the consumer can be guided to pick these up at the store
